            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have been a middle school teacher for fifteen years. I am currently working as a sixth grade math and science teacher. While working full-time, I am completeing a coding bootcamp through Vanderbilt University to become certified as a Full Stack Web Developer. I plan on updating my profile with more work as I continue my education. I am set to complete this course May 25, 2022, and am interested in starting a career in this quickly growing field.</p>
