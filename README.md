This is the second challenge for my coding bootcamp.

My portfolio starts with a heading and navigation links to easily jump to the sections included.

The first section is a short introduction to myself and the current journey I am on to become a certified Full Stack Web Developer. This section includes a picture of me.

The second section displays three projects that I have completed during my bootcamp. The first of these is represented with an image that is about twice the size of the other two, as per instructions.
You can click on each image to open the applications in your browser.

The last section is my contact information, where you will find linked images to my email, GitHub page and LinkedIn profile.

Finally, I have included a footer with my name, copyrite icon and the year.

Below, you should see a screenshot of my deployed webpage.
